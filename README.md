# Exercise - Node.js Express API

In this exercise, we will be creating a simple [Express](https://expressjs.com/) server that:

- Runs on `http://localhost:3000`
- Returns all Pokemons data as JSON at `http://localhost:3000/pokemons`
- Returns one Pokemon data as JSON based on their name `http://localhost:3000/pokemons/<name>`. If no Pokemon data is found, return `Not Found`
- Returns responses with the right [HTTP response status code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status)

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have Node and NPM installed:

```bash
$ node -v
v14.17.6 # Example

$ npm -v
6.14.15 # Example
```

2. Fork this repo by clicking the "Fork" button in GitHub UI

3. Clone the forked repo

```
$ git clone git@github.com:YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME_HERE/exercise-node-express-rest-basic.git
```
