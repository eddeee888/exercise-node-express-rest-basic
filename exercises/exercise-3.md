# Exercise 3 - REST API

1. Set up connection from the Express server to the Database using a query builder e.g. [Knex.js](https://knexjs.org/)

2. Set up/update REST endpoints to:

- Get all pokemons
- Get a specific pokemon
- Add a new type
- Add a new pokemon and its types
- Update a pokemon's name, ID or types
- Delete a pokemon

Hint: You will be working with Event Loop and Promises in JavaScript
